# Linear Algerbra
This is a linear algebra library I'm trying to implement for some 
neural network projects I plan on doing in the near future. (Hopefully 
with openFrameworks)

### Note
* I could of course use a prebuilt library, and perhaps later on I will, but 
for now, I want to get a feel of the math involved

* Perhaps linear algera isn't the best name to give this library since I'll only 
add functionality required for NeuralNets as needed.
